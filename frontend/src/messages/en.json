    "biography": {
        "main": "Alain Puech born 1958 in Marseille. BT in applied arts and DNSEP in art. I'm more of a draughtsman than a painter. I worked in advertising as a freelance illustrator for a few years, and from 1985 I devoted myself entirely to my artistic work. I have produced collective works and public commissions with the Silo and Artstudio groups. I have worked with a number of different techniques (dry and oil pastels, pencils, inks, etc.). My work revolves around the body, dance and portraiture. I work exclusively in series. A “serial drawer” of sorts. Since April 2008, I've been making a self-portrait every day. I've also been running a municipal art school since 2006."
